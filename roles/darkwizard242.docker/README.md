None

## Example Playbook

For default behaviour of role (i.e. installation of **docker** package) in ansible playbooks.

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - darkwizard242.docker
```

For customizing behavior of role (i.e. utilizing an existing or creating a new user to be added to docker group - example shown below is using `darkwizard242` as a user) in ansible playbooks.

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - darkwizard242.docker
  vars:
    docker_user: darkwizard242
```

For customizing behavior of role (i.e. un-installation of **docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, containerd.io** packages) in ansible playbooks.

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
    - darkwizard242.docker
  vars:
    docker_apps_desired_state: absent
```
